# Updates + September Event!!

Dear friends,

We hope you're having a great summer! Below we're going to invite you to come out with us to an event in early September.

But first, here's what's been happening.

### People Are Paying Attention

Because of our rally and public comment event at the May Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority (BCTDA) board meeting, people are paying attention!

If you missed out on that event, [you can read all about it here](https://www.yahoo.com/news/asheville-workers-call-tda-put-092123185.html).

Even the Buncombe County government's staff has been making recommendations to put BCTDA money to the use of subsidizing the construction of income-restricted homes for working people and their families. [In a presentation this spring](https://www.buncombecounty.org/common/Commissioners/20230314%20Budget/7_%20TDA%20Administration%20Fee%20and%20TPDF%20Cycle.pdf), staff went as far as adopting the language of the Tourism Taxes for Affordable Housing campaign, noting that such housing would be "utilized by residents that are likely to be employed in the service, hospitality and other industries" related to the tourism economy, as a means to justify the use of occupancy tax money to aid our housing crisis.

### The LIFT Committee is Being Formed

As you know, our campaign is all about targeting a pot of money that's just recently been created by the state government: the "[LIFT fund](https://www.ashevillecvb.com/lift/)."

In the past, the state government prevented the BCTDA from spending money on such things as housing for everyday Ashevilleans. But the LIFT fund is different. So now, as the BCTDA is forming the committee that will oversee how the LIFT fund is spent, this is our opportunity to help the newly empowered BCTDA to do the right thing.

Members of the LIFT fund committee will be chosen, from a pool of applicants, in late September. We want to continue to send the message that LIFT committee members need to represent the interests of Asheville's working people and their families. [Over 2,000 Buncombe residents supported our campaign to send tourism tax funds to housing projects, but also to ask for service worker representation on the new LIFT committee](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/service-worker-affordable-housing-support-and-committee-representation-2/).

We worked HARD to find someone that understands the needs and realities of service workers in our area, and that also has the schedule flexibility to represent those needs in rooms where important discussions and funding decisions are being made. Serving on the LIFT committee is a large time commitment, and it offers no compensation. This is by design; the barriers to such service as this tend to keep working people out of local government board and commission seats.
 
Thankfully, we were excited to learn James Sutherland, who owned and operated Blue Dream Curry House for eight years in downtown Asheville, stepped up and applied. As many of you know, James was not a run-of-the-mill owner and Blue Dream was a model of how restaurants can function year after year while keeping workers at the forefront of decisions. (To learn more about James’s emphasis on workers, wages, and community, [check this out](https://www.mountainbizworks.org/2016/08/01/client-success-story-blue-dream-curry-house-says-no-to-restaurant-status-quo/).)
 
We’re optimistic that the BCTDA will honor the thousands that are urging them to appoint James, the candidate that our coalition enthusiastically endorses, to the LIFT committee.

And then, after September, the brand new LIFT committee will begin accepting grant proposals. We will continue to lobby for the committee to prioritize grants that address our area's greatest infrastructural need: housing.

### Join Us on September 5th

So we'll be back at it, showing up for public comment and sharing our own housing stories, at the September 5th County Commission meeting in downtown Asheville.

We want you to join us, and tell your housing story too!

And afterwards, we'll head to a nearby watering hole, to celebrate all of the ways that we've been raising awareness (and raising eyebrows) since we started in the spring.

[You can find more details and RSVP here](https://tourism-taxes-for-affordable-housing.github.io/ttfah/county-commission-and-celebration.html). And as always, don't hesitate to reach out with any thoughts or questions.
